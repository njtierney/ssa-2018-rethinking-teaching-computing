<!-- Title: Rethinking statistical computing: Understanding how learning -->
<!-- works means we need to rethink how we teach. -->

<!-- Researchers, analysts, and statisticians need to perform analyses, and -->
<!-- this (usually) means that they need to learn how to code. They are, -->
<!-- however, often not taught how to code. So how do they start? This talk -->
<!-- discusses evidence based principles on teaching from the book: \"How -->
<!-- Learning Works\", and how they can be applied to teach statistical -->
<!-- computing. The talk is based off of Nick\'s experience going through -->
<!-- Software Carpentries Trainer Training curriculum, and his experience -->
<!-- learning and teaching R over the past 5 years. -->

In the words of Alex Szalay, these sorts of researchers must be "Pi-shaped" as opposed to the more traditional "T-shaped" researcher. In Szalay's view, a classic PhD program generates T-shaped researchers: scientists with wide-but-shallow general knowledge, but deep skill and expertise in one particular area. The new breed of scientific researchers, the data scientists, must be Pi-shaped: that is, they maintain the same wide breadth, but push deeper both in their own subject area and in the statistical or computational methods that help drive modern research:

**Learning** is a three part process, in which a student:

1. **Receives** information accurately
2. **Remembers** the information (long term memory)
3. In such a way that they can **reapply** the information when appropriate

(**Teaching** is whatever helps a student do that)

    - 5-10 min lecture, then
    - 1-10 min exercises
- Use live coding
