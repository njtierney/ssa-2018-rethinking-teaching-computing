In the words of Alex Szalay, these sorts of researchers must be "Pi-shaped" as opposed to the more traditional "T-shaped" researcher. In Szalay's view, a classic PhD program generates T-shaped researchers: scientists with wide-but-shallow general knowledge, but deep skill and expertise in one particular area. The new breed of scientific researchers, the data scientists, must be Pi-shaped: that is, they maintain the same wide breadth, but push deeper both in their own subject area and in the statistical or computational methods that help drive modern research:

**Learning** is a three part process, in which a student:

1. **Receives** information accurately
2. **Remembers** the information (long term memory)
3. In such a way that they can **reapply** the information when appropriate

(**Teaching** is whatever helps a student do that)
