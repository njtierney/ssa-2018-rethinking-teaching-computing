## Abstract

> **Rethinking statistical computing: Understanding how learning works means we need to rethink how we teach.**

> Researchers, analysts, and statisticians need to perform analyses, and
this (usually) means that they need to learn how to code. They are,
however, often not taught how to code. So how do they start? This talk
discusses evidence based principles on teaching from the book: "How
Learning Works", and how they can be applied to teach statistical
computing. The talk is based off of Nick's experience going through
Software Carpentries Trainer Training curriculum, and his experience
learning and teaching R over the past 5 years.
